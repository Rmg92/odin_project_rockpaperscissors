# Rock Paper Scissor
This is a game of Rock Paper Scisor made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Reflections
The project was divided on 2 parts. The [first part](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) consisted on creating a game that could be played on the console, were the player played a 5 round game against the computer.

This allowed me to put to pratice what I had previously learned on javascript.

For the [second part](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) I had to make the game playable with a simple UI.

This was a bit more complicated than the first part because I had to adapt the my old javascript code to work with the UI and I had some difficulty updating the UI on the last round, but after googling a bit and thinking a lot I managed to find the problem and correct it.
It was also a good lesson on how the git branches work.

## Future
I plan to keep updating this project as I keep learning and until I feel happy with it.

Currently I'm working on improving the design of the page by adding some colors, animations and images, but I also plan to revisit the javascript code in the future.
